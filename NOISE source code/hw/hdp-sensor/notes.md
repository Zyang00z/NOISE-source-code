 - Phone sensors
 - Call?
 - Would it be advantageous to make the sound sources even smaller?


Is this the look you are going for, or would you actually  I have an instinct that most headphones probably have a metal band in them, and i'm hopeful that the same sensors could be applied to other headphones if needed. Anyway, I would be keen to work out what works best for what you want to achieve, and find a solution to the question of what set of headphones to use
